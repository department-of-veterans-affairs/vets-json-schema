    1. Create a PR in `vets-website` to update the `vets-json-schema` dependency
        - This can be done with `yarn update:schema`

  - Breaking changes include:
    - Removing a property from a schema
    - Adding a property to a schema that has `additionalProperties` set to false
    - Making a property required that was not previously required on that schema
    - Changing the `type` on a schema's property
    - Removing values in the `enum` key of a schema's property
    - ect.
- Run `npm update` update `package-lock.json`.
- Commit the changes to `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
- After changes to `vets-json-schema` have been merged into master:
    + update `vets-website` to point to the latest `vets-json-schema` version by running `yarn update:schema` and making a PR
    + update `vets-api` by running `bundle update vets_json_schema` and making a PR.  _Caution: verify that you changes are only related to vets_json_schema version.
